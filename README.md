# Text Similarity Flask App | Bag Of Words and Cosine Similarity

## Introduction

Created a Flask app to check text similarity using Bag Of Words and Cosine Similarity metric. It does not consider punctuations and the position of the words. Takes two text inputs from the user and performs similarity check by creating Bag Of Words (dictionary of frequency of each word in the text; {word:frequency}) and using Cosine Similarity (a metric used to measure how similar two vectors are.) 

## Technologies Used
Programming Language:<br>
    python3<br>
    HTML and JavaScript (for creating UI and sending the user's input data as a POST request) <br> 

## To Run: 

**Method 1 - Pulling the image from DockerHub:** <br>
    `docker pull pooyadav209712/text-similarity:latest` <br>
    `docker run -p 80:80 pooyadav209712/text-similarity:latest`

**Method 2 - Cloning the GitHub repository:** <br>
    Clone the repository<br>
    cd to the cloned folder and within that folder run command <br> `docker build -t text-similarity .` using terminal. <br> 
    Once the docker image is created run command `docker run -p 80:80 text-similarity`

**Method 3 - Python run:** <br> 
    Clone the repository <br>
    run the follwing commands on the terminal <br> `source env/bin/activate` <br>
                                              `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` <br>
                                              `python3 app.py` <br>
    It will run on the url http://127.0.0.1:80
